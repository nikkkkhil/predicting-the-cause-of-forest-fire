# Forest Fire Cause Prediction

The United States Forest Service has compiled a [national database of forest fires spanning from 1992 to 2015](https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/Product/RDS-2013-0009.4/).  Naturally occuring forest fires are a normal process which clears out old, overgrown forests and resets the local ecosystem.  To prevent unecessary destruction to life and property, the Forest Service, and other similar government agencies, employ a variety of fire management techniques, including prescribed burns, fuel reduction, and mechanical treatments.  However, the last several decades have seen an increase in the number, ferocity, and size of wildfires.  With larger populations moving into forested areas, wildfire suppression operations in the [Wildland Urban Interface](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/climate/why-california-fires.html) have become the [norm](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/27/climate/wildfire-global-warming.html).

[Nearly 85% of wildfires](https://www.nps.gov/articles/wildfire-causes-and-evaluation.htm) are caused by humans. Understanding and predicting the causes of wildfires can assist investigators bring arsonists to justice, inform the public of the actual causes of wildfires, and be the catalyst for abatement strategies.
